# YABA - Yet Another Budgeting App

A self hostable API for personal expense tracking built with [FastAPI](https://github.com/fastapi/fastapi)

## Context

There are many great opensource options for personal finance tracking. However, I felt like they were either too feature full or lacking particular features I was looking for.
YABA strives to achieve a middle ground where it can track your personal finances and share the progress with your significant other so that multiple people can register expenses on the same account.

**WARNING**: This API is still in early stages of development.

## Technology

I chose FastAPI because python was my first language and since I'm not a backend engineer, I prefered to ignore the barrier of a new language to make it easier to progress.
I've built a couple tools using Django and worked in a professional setting with Flask, so I wanted to learn a new framework and FastAPI seemed promissing.

## Contributing

This is my first opensource project that I am looking for contributions for and I am still learning how to manage this ☺
